# In Subsunk, the journalist Ed Lines, stranded aboard the wrecked submarine
# Sea Lion, successfully sent a distress signal to headquarters and now awaits
# rescue. But the message has been intercepted by enemy agents, who arrange for
# Sea Lion to be towed into Seabase Delta, where she will not be found. Ed
# Lines emerges from the submarine to find the Seabase mysteriously deserted;
# he must discover its secrets and escape.
